223,8,1,2,1,"A crime against beef. Overcooked, underwhelming, and a disgrace to every steakhouse that does this right.",
224,9,3,19,1,"Raw fish is meant to be delicate, not flavorless. This is an insult to seafood—zero seasoning, zero excitement, just sad.",
225,9,7,63,2,"Stuffed meat can be incredible, but not when it's this dry. It's like chewing on an old wallet. Where's the moisture? Where's the flavor?",
226,9,1,4,1,"Dry, bland, and completely overcooked. Whoever did this to a beautiful cut of beef should be banned from the kitchen.",
227,10,5,46,2,"The sauce is quite buttery, which is lovely, but it needs a little something more—perhaps a touch of spice to bring it to life!",
228,10,7,63,1,"Oh dear, this one missed the mark! The stuffing was far too dense, and it was quite dry. A bit more love and it could be wonderful!",
229,10,1,4,2,"Now, this is a perfectly fine steak, but I do think it could be a bit more exciting. Perhaps a lovely sauce to lift it up?",
230,11,4,28,1,"Mmm… not quite my thing. The flavors didn't seem to work together.",
231,11,5,45,1,"Something about this felt off. Maybe the seasoning was a little too strong?",
232,11,8,70,1,"I know people love it, but I just couldn't get into it. Too much going on.",
233,12,10,94,2,"Darling, I expected something more refined! This was just ordinary greens.",
234,12,1,10,1,"Too simple, too plain, not enough drama for moi!",
235,12,3,25,2,"A bit underwhelming. Needs something bolder to match my energy!",
236,13,9,88,1,"Wocka wocka… is this even chicken? Too dry, too bland, not funny!",
237,13,9,89,2,"A sandwich with potential, but it needed more kick. Where's the punchline?",
238,13,8,74,1,"Cold, sour, and not my style. I like my meals warm, like my comedy!",
239,14,4,33,1,"Oohhh, too much peppy spicey! Bork bork bork, my mouth on fire!",
240,14,3,25,2,"Too light! Needs moar cheezy, moar saucey, moar bork!",
241,14,4,28,2,"Some goood, some meh. Needs bork bork improvements!",

244,15,4,28,1,"All over the place—some bites were great, others just confusing!",
245,16,10,93,2,"Eh, kinda thick and heavy. Not bad, but not my favorite either.",
246,16,10,94,1,"Too much lettuce, not enough cheese or meat. Where's the good stuff?",
247,16,8,74,1,"Cold seafood? Nope, not for me. I need something heartier.",
